### 1.0.6

### 1.0.5

* Fix python_requires, the expression acidentally excluded Python
  3.11. We should now correctly support it.

### 1.0.4

  well.

### 1.0.3

  escaped for both quotations and non-printable characters.

* Fix bug when printing smtlib comments with newlines.

### 1.0.1

  contribute correctly to the logic selection.

  currently supports).
